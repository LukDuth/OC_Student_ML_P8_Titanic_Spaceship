# OC_Student_ML_P8_Titanic_Spaceship
This is the repository where I store and manage successive versions of my python script [a Jupyter Lab Notebook]. 
This notebook deals with "Spaceship Titanic" Kaggle Competition, on the context of a student project (IML nÂ°8) as required by OpenClassrooms. 

Branches' roles (by order of creation):
- 1) main : 
1st versions of notebook, and then each time a new version is born, we upload it whithin main branch
- 2) filling_missing_values : 
for 2nd version of notebook, we change the way to fill missing values, we choose a smarter way, using strong relationsjips between features
- 3) encoding_and_testing_scalings : 
3rd version, we encode categorical features, and we put to test some kinds of scalings
- 4) testing_classifiers :
4th version, we keep only the best scaling, and we put to test two classifiers (after optimization of hyper-parameters and cross validation)
- 5) prediction_and_results_submission :
5th version of notebook, we keep only the best classifier, and we make the prediction over test set
- 6) final_version :
6th version, we add PEP8 standard, and we add some markdowns commentaries
